# Web-UI-Sean

The UI protion of Lambda build week #1. A landing and about page for the app, BetterProfessor.

The BetterProfessor app helps professors plan their interactions and communicate directly with students. It lets them remember important deadlines and check on their student's progress to ensure success.

Included in the repo is the main landing page. This advertises basic information about the application in a way that should be enticing to the target audience. The design is meant to be simple but visually appealing to keep user interest. Also included is an about page which serves as the credits for all who worked on this project. The team profiles were accomplished through component based design.
